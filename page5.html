<p>When your work revolves around other people and engaging with them effectively, a patient and empathetic temperament are key.<p>

<p>Furthermore, if you want to work in the tourism industry then you should be well traveled or at least have the desire to be. This is because traveling can be extremely hectic if you are not enjoying it and then trying to make a career out of it can prove to be extremely challenging.<p>

<p>Whether or not this is a lucrative career is a very relative question. That’s because the opportunities a person is given and where they go from there will vary from one to the other. But is there room to turn this into a high-paying source of income? Yes, there is definitely room. Whether or not you make it happen depends on your personal initiative.</p>

<h3>Business Opportunities</h3>

<P>When you have the knowledge and required skills for event management and planning you can even look into starting a small business. The good thing about that is that there is the very little cost required for set up.</P>

<p>You will be offering a service and the expenses for the event will be paid by the client. This leaves you with the work and organization only. If you know how to do that, this arrangement could really work for you.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of ceremonies and events after all.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this line of work can be very interesting and lucrative if you are a people person and good at planning and organization.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
